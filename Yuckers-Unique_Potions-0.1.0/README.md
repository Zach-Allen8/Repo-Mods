A simple mod that adds a few valuables and items in the form of potions. Be warned: this mod is not thoroughly tested in multiplayer.



# The Potions (Valuables)

### The Gravity Potion

Creates a large, permanent field of anti gravity around where it breaks.



### The Gold Potion

A ***highly*** saught after potion. Splash this on any valuables and they'll sell for 20% more.



### Health Potion

Heals all players by 20 (40 in singleplayer) and valuables by 10% in its splash radius.



### Unstable Potion

This potion sells for quite a bit, but be careful. Your grab beam seems to start a 30 second chain reaction that makes the potion shake violently and eventually explode! Be quick to extract it.



# The Elixirs (Items)

### The Stamina Elixir

A reusable consumable elixir purchaseable from your local service station. It grants full stamina and has three charges that refill every level.


## Planned Content

**Rage Potion (Valuable):**
All players in the splash radius will become invulnerable and start flailing violently for a short time, dealing high damage. Be careful around your valuables.

**Feather Potion (Valuable):**
Permanently applies the feather effect to all objects in its splash radius.

**Custom models and sounds:**
Each potion and elixir will have a unique look with their own custom models and sounds made by me!

**Your Suggestions!**
I'm happy to take in your ideas. The crazier the idea the better.
