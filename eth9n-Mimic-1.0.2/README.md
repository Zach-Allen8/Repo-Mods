# Mimic

Mimic is a Skinwalker (Lethal Company Mod) inspired mod for R.E.P.O that allows the creatures of the game to sound like you or your friends!

### Notice:

This is my first mod and is in a very early state and has plenty of bugs that I will be working to fix when I get the chance. I mainly wanted to upload this mod to easy the installation process for my friends.

### Planned Additions:

- Caching audio in memory (no more writing files)
- Better audio detection (less silent clips)
- Configuration file (customize frequency of clips)
- Optimizations!

### Changelog
- 1.0.1 : Fixed bugs and alleviated lag when sending audio to clients.

### Known bugs:

- Voices will stop playing when the host of the room has died.
